Welcome to the Anthym Programming Language's homepage! Anthym is a statically typed programming language that can be AOT or JIT compiled. Cross-compilation is slightly broken right now, but it will work. It is written in Rust, and the standard library is currently written in C. Soon, though, it will be changed to be written in itself.
